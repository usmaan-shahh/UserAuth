level: 'debug' means All logs will be captured, including:

logger.debug()
logger.info()
logger.warn()
logger.error()

Each transport is a destination where logs go

logFormat: how log's  are structured before being written to files.

Because no level is specified, Logs ALL log levels into one file.
level: "error",  Logs ONLY error-level logs to error.log.

exceptionHandlers: Catches uncaught exceptions and logs them instead of silently crashing.
rejectionHandlers: Logs unhandled promise rejections automatically.


Morgan collects request and response metaData, formats it, and then send log's to Winston for storage. 

  error    ---(0)   
  warn     ---(1)
  info     ---(2)
  http     ---(3)
 verbose   ---(4) 
  debug    ---(5)
  silly    ---(6) 


An API is a contract that defines what must be exposed and exchanged during the request–response cycle, without exposing implementation.

HTTP provides the syntax and transport rules for requests and responses between a client and a server., while REST provides the semantics - how HTTP methods and resources should be interpreted by the server.

RESTful APIs follow REST principles that define how APIs should be designed using resource-based URLs,  stateless communication, and leveraging standard HTTP methods, status codes, and headers.
