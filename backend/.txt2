level: 'debug' means All logs will be captured, including:

logger.debug()
logger.info()
logger.warn()
logger.error()

Each transport is a destination where logs go

logFormat: how log's  are structured before being written to files.

Because no level is specified, Logs ALL log levels into one file.
level: "error",  Logs ONLY error-level logs to error.log.

exceptionHandlers: Catches uncaught exceptions and logs them instead of silently crashing.
rejectionHandlers: Logs unhandled promise rejections automatically.
